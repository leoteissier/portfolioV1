    In my free time, I enjoy exploring new web development
    tools and techniques to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.<br>
    I also like to work on personal coding projects to challenge myself and improve my skills.<br>
    Outside of web development, I'm an avid sports fan, and I enjoy doing calisthenics with my friends.<br>
    I also love travelling and discovering new cultures, and I find that it often inspires me in my creative work.<br>
    Finally, I enjoy reading about technology and entrepreneurship and learning from the experiences of successful business leaders.<br>
